## What is it?
This was coded by me a few years ago when building my first mobile APP with web technology.
At that time the only JS libraries I could find were extremely bloated and full of unneeded features.
For my case - I only needed to manipulate the DOM, have a few transitions between pages,
handle events and interact with the API.

## Demo
There is a mobile APP live built on this, which is performing reasonably well.
If you are curious to see it in action, go ahead and try out the APP:
[Appstore](https://itunes.apple.com/lt/app/vupt!-agua-gas/id984136325),
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.vupt.app),
[Youtube demo](https://youtu.be/BeNKyzvOYUU).

## What can I do with it?
In the end this turned out to be a great learning experience for me and a decent DOM manipulation JS library.
Feel free to use it for anything you wish - inspiration/learning/development/production.

It is not fully finished, however I stopped doing anything with it, so feel free to contribute if you do anything with it.
